# Untitled

This is my *untitled* art project on different aspects of reality. Instalation will consist of camera connected to server computer, witch detects the human face onlive, and client raspberry pi computer, connected to thermal printer. 

Thermal printer will print continuously one-dimentional (or two-dimentional if you consider time as second dimention) cellural automata. Printer will work only if server detects human face. Server will be connected to display, so that viewer could have impression of influence on the situation.

There are several philosophical references here - from the idea of deism through observer effect up to AI self-awareness problem.

Work will be exhibited in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland in 2017.
